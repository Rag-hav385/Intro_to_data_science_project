## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
data = read.csv('dataset.csv')
data$Cluster = as.character(data$Cluster)
str(data)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data,aes(x=Fuel_mass,y=Cluster)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "#66c2a5", color = "#7570b3") + 
  labs(title = "Fuel Mass across the Clusters",
       x = "Fuel Mass",
       y = "Cluster") +  
  theme_minimal() 
cache=FALSE
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
#Taking Throttle dataset
data_thro <- data %>% select(matches("Throttle|Cluster"))
colnames(data_thro)
```
<p> 
Absolute Throttle Position B(%): 
  This is the percentage at which the throttle is open. It's important because it shows how much power the engine is producing relative to its maximum capacity.

</p>

<br>
<p>
W.R.T Fuel Consumption :
 Aggressive acceleration and high throttle positions generally lead to higher fuel consumption, as more fuel is injected to produce the desired power.
 </p>
 

```{r}
#Throttle for absolute position

Absolute_pos <- data_thro[c('Absolute.Throttle.Position.B...' , 'Cluster')]

bplot <- ggplot(Absolute_pos,aes(x= Absolute.Throttle.Position.B... ,y=Cluster)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "red", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Absolute Throttle Position across the Clusters",
       x = "Absolute Throttle Position",
       y = "Cluster") +  
  theme_minimal() 
cache=FALSE

bplot
```

<h2> Observations </h2>
<p>

The Box plot is suggesting , Abs. Throttle position was one of the factor responsible for higher fuel mass consumption.

</p>
```{r}
ggplot(data_thro, aes(x = Absolute.Throttle.Position.B...)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 1.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ Cluster) +  
  labs(title = "Histograms by Cluster for Abs Throttle Pos.", x = "Absolute_Throttle_position", y = "Frequency")
```
```{r}
print("===============")
for (x in 1:5) {
  data_temp = data_thro[data_thro$Cluster == as.character(x),]
  t_test = t.test(data_temp$Absolute.Throttle.Position.B...)
  
  print("For Cluster")
  print(x)
  print(t_test$conf.int)
  
  print("-------------")
}
```
# Comparing Cluster 4 and Cluster 5
```{r}
data_thro_c <- data_thro[data_thro$Cluster == "4" | data_thro$Cluster == "5",]
ggplot(data_thro_c, aes(x = Absolute.Throttle.Position.B..., fill = Cluster)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.4)
```

<Observations>

<p>
A left shift of [14.65690 15.31923] has better fuel Mass consumption than [16.16190 17.72771]
