**Interpretations:**

**Fleet2**

**Engine_Coolant_Temperature_degreesC**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between engine coolant temperature and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2.

**Intake_Manifold_Absolute_Pressure_kPa**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between intake manifold absolute pressure and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2.

**Engine_RPM_RPM**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between engine RPM and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2.

**Vehicle_Speed_Sensor_km_h**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between vehicle speed sensor readings and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2.

**Intake_Air_Temperature_degreesC**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between intake air temperature and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2. 

**Absolute_Throttle_Position_**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between absolute throttle position and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2. 

**Intake_Air_Temperature_A_degreesC**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between an alternate measure of intake air temperature and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2.

**Ambient_Air_Temperature_degreesC**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between ambient air temperature and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2. 

**Accelerator_Pedal_Position_D_**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) between accelerator pedal position (D) and Air_Flow_Rate_from_Mass_Flow_Sensor_g_s in fleet2. 

**Accelerator_Pedal_Position_E_**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) exists between accelerator pedal position (E) and the variable. 

**Engine_Coolant_Temperature_A_degreesC**

Interpretation: Highly significant relationship (p < 2e-16) exists between an alternate measure of engine coolant temperature and the variable.
