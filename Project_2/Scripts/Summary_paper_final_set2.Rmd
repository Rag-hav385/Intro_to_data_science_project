## Dataset

Collecting On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) data is pivotal for vehicle diagnostics, offering insights into engine health, performance, and fuel efficiency. However, limitations arise when working with data from a single car and driver. The dataset's lack of diversity hinders broad conclusions and predictions due to the limited representation of driving conditions and behaviors. This data's inherent bias makes it challenging to apply findings universally. External factors impacting fuel economy are unaccounted for, and the dataset's parameters may not suffice for accurate predictions. To enhance reliability, a more extensive, diverse dataset spanning various vehicles, drivers, and conditions is essential for meaningful OBD data analysis.

When analyzing the relationship between various parameters and fuel mass in a vehicle, it's essential to consider the dynamic and complex nature of these connections. Several trip-related parameters, such as "Run Time Since Engine Start (s)," "Speed (OBD) (km/h)," and "Speed (GPS) (km/h)," influence fuel consumption but in intricate ways that defy simple descriptive analysis.

Run Time Since Engine Start (s):
The "Run Time Since Engine Start (s)" column represents the duration of engine operation from the moment the engine is turned on. This parameter captures the warm-up phase of engine operation, where the engine operates in a less fuel-efficient mode, consuming more fuel per unit of time. Analyzing this variable descriptively may not yield straightforward insights because it encompasses a transient phase of engine operation influenced by cold start conditions.

Speed (OBD) (km/h):
"Speed (OBD) (km/h)" records vehicle speed as reported by the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) system. While higher speeds generally lead to increased air resistance and fuel consumption, the relationship is non-linear. Factors like engine efficiency, vehicle weight, and vehicle-specific characteristics influence fuel consumption. Descriptive analysis may not capture the nuances of how speed influences fuel mass without accounting for these additional factors.

Speed (GPS) (km/h):
Similar to OBD-based speed, "Speed (GPS) (km/h)" measures vehicle speed but using GPS data. While higher speeds are associated with increased air resistance and potential fuel consumption, the relationship is complex and influenced by road conditions, terrain, and driving behavior. The precision and accuracy of GPS speed data can also vary, making it challenging to draw precise conclusions from this variable without considering these confounding factors


#### Environment and Temperature Related Parameters
```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
environment_and_temperature_related_not_following_parameters <- c("Barometric.pressure..from.vehicle..psi.", "Engine.Coolant.Temperature..C.", "Intake.Manifold.Pressure.psi.")
# Create a list of plots
plot_list <- lapply(environment_and_temperature_related_not_following_parameters, function(variable) {
  dataset %>%
    mutate(!!sym(variable) := ifelse(is.na(!!sym(variable)), 0, !!sym(variable))) %>%
    mutate(bin = cut(!!sym(variable), breaks = 4)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = bin, y = Fuel_mass)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab(paste(variable, " Bins"))
})

# Combine the plots into a 2x2 grid
grid_of_plots <- grid.arrange(
  grobs = plot_list,
  ncol = 2  # You can adjust the number of columns as needed
)

# Print or display the grid of plots
grid_of_plots
```

<br>

Barometric Pressure (from vehicle) (psi):
Barometric pressure represents the atmospheric pressure at the vehicle's location and affects the density of air entering the engine, which, in turn, impacts combustion efficiency and fuel consumption. However, this relationship is non-linear and depends on factors like engine design, fuel composition, and driving conditions. Descriptive analysis may not adequately capture the intricate interplay between barometric pressure and fuel mass.

Engine Coolant Temperature (°C):
Engine coolant temperature affects engine efficiency, but its impact on fuel mass is complex. Colder engines may be less fuel-efficient during warm-up but can become more efficient once they reach their optimal operating temperature. The specific effect depends on the engine's design and temperature range.

Intake Manifold Pressure (psi):
"Intake Manifold Pressure (psi)" influences combustion efficiency and fuel consumption. Higher pressures can improve combustion efficiency, but excessive pressures may increase fuel consumption. However, this relationship depends on various engine-specific factors, making descriptive analysis insufficient to understand its impact fully.


#### Voltage Related Parameters

```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
voltage_related_not_following_parameters <- c("Voltage..Control.Module..V.", "Voltage..OBD.Adapter..V.")

# Create a list of plots
plot_list <- lapply(voltage_related_not_following_parameters, function(variable) {
  dataset %>%
    mutate(!!sym(variable) := ifelse(is.na(!!sym(variable)), 0, !!sym(variable))) %>%
    mutate(bin = cut(!!sym(variable), breaks = 4)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = bin, y = Fuel_mass)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab(paste(variable, " Bins"))
})

# Combine the plots into a 2x2 grid
grid_of_plots <- grid.arrange(
  grobs = plot_list,
  ncol = 2  # You can adjust the number of columns as needed
)

# Print or display the grid of plots
print(grid_of_plots)
```

<br>

Voltage (Control Module) (V):
Stable voltage levels are essential for the reliable operation of fuel injection and ignition systems. Fluctuations in voltage can impact the precise operation of these systems, but the relationship is non-linear and complex, depending on voltage range, engine design, and other factors that affect fuel mass.

Voltage (OBD Adapter) (V):
Similar to control module voltage, OBD adapter voltage stability is crucial for data collection and communication between vehicle systems. Variations in OBD adapter voltage could impact data accuracy and, indirectly, fuel consumption. Descriptive analysis alone may not elucidate these subtleties without considering specific voltage levels and their consequences on fuel mass.


#### Throttle and Pedal Related Parameters

```{r echo=FALSE,results='hide',fig.keep='all'}

throttle_related_not_following_parameters <- c("Absolute.Throttle.Position.B...", "Relative.Throttle.Position...","Throttle.Position.Manifold....")

# Create a list of plots
plot_list <- lapply(throttle_related_not_following_parameters, function(variable) {
  dataset %>%
    mutate(!!sym(variable) := ifelse(is.na(!!sym(variable)), 0, !!sym(variable))) %>%
    mutate(bin = cut(!!sym(variable), breaks = 4)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = bin, y = Fuel_mass)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab(paste(variable, " Bins"))
})

# Combine the plots into a 2x2 grid
grid_of_plots <- grid.arrange(
  grobs = plot_list,
  ncol = 2  # You can adjust the number of columns as needed
)

# Print or display the grid of plots
print(grid_of_plots)
```

<br>

Throttle Position (Manifold) (%):
Throttle position affects air intake and spark timing, which influence combustion efficiency and fuel consumption. The relationship between throttle position and fuel mass is intricate and dynamic, influenced by various factors, necessitating a more comprehensive investigation or modeling approach.

Absolute Throttle Position B (%):
Aggressive acceleration and high throttle positions typically result in elevated fuel consumption, but the connection between these parameters and fuel mass is complex. It depends on driver behavior, road conditions, and engine response, requiring a detailed analysis for precise quantification.

Relative Throttle Position (%):
Similar to absolute throttle position, relative throttle position influences fuel consumption, but its dynamic interaction with fuel mass involves various variables. Descriptive analysis provides an overview, but gaining a precise understanding necessitates a more nuanced analysis.

In our analysis of the distribution of fuel mass among clusters, we initially focused on a plot with five clusters. The fifth cluster stood out from the others due to its distinct segregation, and we identified it as exhibiting undesirable characteristics. Based on this, we made specific recommendations to address these issues.

We then expanded our analysis to six clusters and observed an overlap between the fifth and third clusters, as well as between the second and first clusters. Further examination of the plot with seven clusters revealed overlapping patterns between clusters 5 and 4, 7 and 6, and 3 and 2. This lack of clear demarcation in both the six and seven-cluster scenarios makes it challenging to pinpoint a single cluster as a standout "bad cluster" for targeted recommendations.

#### Solution Building

![Solution Approach](C:\Users\ragha\OneDrive\Desktop\Data_science\Data_sciecne_project_1\Solution - Approach.png)
<br>

The methodology begins with the clustering of trips using the silhouette method, a popular technique for determining the optimal number of clusters. The silhouette method evaluates how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster compared to neighboring clusters, providing a measure of cluster quality. This step helps determine the most appropriate number of clusters for the dataset, ensuring that the resulting clusters are internally cohesive and well-separated.

Once the trips are clustered, the next phase involves a detailed descriptive analysis to compare the right or left shift in fuel mass consumption among these clusters.

The methodology begins with the understanding that Cluster 5 consumes more fuel than the rest of the clusters. As a result, the analysis focuses on comparing the other clusters against Cluster 5 to determine better confidence intervals based on whether the variables are directly or indirectly proportional to fuel mass.

For variables that are directly proportional to fuel mass, we expect to observe a left shift in fuel consumption when they decrease. This is because less reading of the variable, which is directly linked to fuel mass, will result in lower fuel consumption. For example, a variable like CO..in.g.km..Average..g.km. is directly proportional to fuel consumption; as speed decreases, fuel consumption tends to decrease as well.

Conversely, for variables that are indirectly proportional to fuel mass, we anticipate a right shift in fuel consumption as these variables increase. This is because more  reading of the variable indirectly linked to fuel mass would lead to lower fuel consumption. An example of an indirectly proportional variable is Engine.Coolant.Temperature..C.. Higher value of the variable results in lower fuel consumption as per the descriptive definition.

To ensure the robustness of these findings, confidence intervals are calculated for the relevant parameters, helping to determine the statistical significance of the shifts observed in each cluster.

In summary, this refined methodology not only identifies the shifts in fuel mass consumption but also delves into the specific variables contributing to these shifts, differentiating between those that are directly or indirectly proportional to fuel mass. This approach allows for precise recommendations tailored to each cluster's characteristics, ultimately enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing operational costs.

The Trip Average KPL (kilometers per liter) parameter is crucial for assessing a vehicle's fuel efficiency, quantifying how far it can travel on one liter of fuel. When analyzing data, considering confidence intervals (CI) is vital. Cluster 5 has a CI of 11.81 - 12.15, suggesting its average KPL falls within this range. In contrast, Cluster 2 has a wider CI of 12.97240 - 13.21055, indicating a higher average KPL. Higher KPL signifies better fuel efficiency, making Cluster 2 more efficient. This insight is valuable for individuals and fleet managers seeking to optimize vehicle performance and reduce fuel costs. It underlines the importance of the Trip Average KPL parameter in fuel efficiency assessment.

```
<br>

"Litres Per 100 Kilometer (Long Term Average)" is a fundamental parameter for assessing vehicle fuel efficiency, measuring fuel consumption over a specific distance. Lower values signify enhanced efficiency. The analysis focuses on "Cluster 5" and "Cluster 2," each with distinct confidence intervals (CI).
In "Cluster 5," the CI for long-term average fuel consumption is [8.41 - 8.80], while "Cluster 2" features a narrower CI of [7.62 - 7.95], indicating higher confidence in its lower fuel consumption.
While it's not ideal for direct recommendations, this analysis offers a valuable benchmark for better fuel efficiency. Understanding the distinction between these clusters aids individuals, organizations, and fleet managers in optimizing fuel consumption and operational costs, underlining the significance of fuel efficiency in vehicle performance.

Engine Coolant Temperature (°C) is pivotal for assessing fuel efficiency and engine performance. A properly warmed engine operates efficiently, enhancing fuel economy. Comparing Cluster 5 and Cluster 2, Cluster 5's temperature range is [88.1 - 88.5], and Cluster 2 has a slightly wider range of [88.8 - 89.0], with higher confidence. While this suggests Cluster 2 maintains more efficient temperatures, the limited data variation makes it challenging to recommend decisively. Nevertheless, it underscores the importance of engine temperature control for improved fuel efficiency and performance. Further data variability is essential for stronger conclusions.

```{r}
environment_and_temperature_related_parameters <- c("CO..in.g.km..Average..g.km.","Engine.Coolant.Temperature..C.",

Intake Air Temperature (°C) is a critical parameter for evaluating vehicle fuel efficiency and engine performance. This temperature directly influences the combustion process, affecting air density and oxygen content in the engine intake manifold.
In Cluster 1, with a confidence interval of [34.6 - 35.7], cooler air leads to denser, oxygen-rich intake air, potentially enhancing combustion efficiency, engine performance, and fuel economy. The narrower confidence interval in Cluster 1 signifies consistently maintaining this beneficial temperature range.
This recommendation is clear: optimizing intake air temperature akin to Cluster 1 can significantly improve fuel efficiency and engine performance. Regular air intake system maintenance and temperature control are essential, along with fuel-efficient driving practices. This analysis underscores the importance of maintaining optimal intake air temperatures for peak combustion efficiency and substantial fuel savings.

The analysis of O2 Volts Bank 1 Sensor 1 (V) in both Cluster 5 and Cluster 1 for O2 Volts Bank 1 Sensor 1 (V) <= 4.5, and similarly in Cluster 5 and Cluster 4 for O2 Volts Bank 1 Sensor 1 (V) > 4.5 reveals insightful data. However, crafting precise recommendations solely from this information is challenged by consistent driving behavior. In situations where O2 Volts Bank 1 Sensor 1 (V) <= 4.5, narrow confidence intervals are exhibited by both clusters, indicating consistent air-fuel mixture regulation and likely improved fuel economy. Conversely, when O2 Volts Bank 1 Sensor 1 (V) > 4.5, the intervals are broadened slightly, still suggesting effective air-fuel mixture management. To offer more accurate recommendations, a broader set of parameters reflecting various aspects of driving behavior and engine performance should be considered, enabling a comprehensive understanding of fuel efficiency and more effective optimization strategies.

Analyzing throttle and pedal positions in "Cluster 4" and "Cluster 5" reveals the critical connection between driver behavior, engine power control, and fuel consumption. In "Cluster 4," tight confidence intervals indicate consistent, moderate throttle and pedal usage, showcasing how drivers manage power and acceleration. Conversely, "Cluster 5" exhibits wider intervals, signifying greater variability in driver behaviors, potentially leading to more aggressive acceleration and higher throttle and pedal positions.
These insights underscore the pivotal role of driver actions in fuel consumption. More aggressive acceleration and maintaining high positions demand increased fuel injection, significantly impacting fuel economy. Consequently, a vehicle's fuel efficiency is largely shaped by how drivers handle these inputs.

These findings emphasize that drivers can influence fuel economy by adopting smoother acceleration and avoiding excessive throttle and pedal use, akin to "Cluster 4." This approach not only saves on fuel costs but also aligns with eco-conscious driving, reducing emissions and promoting responsible driving practices.
In conclusion, understanding how driver behaviors affect engine power and fuel consumption is vital for individuals and organizations aiming to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint. Prioritizing balanced and controlled acceleration leads to improved fuel efficiency, cost savings, and eco-friendly driving practices.
